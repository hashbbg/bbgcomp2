# Browser-Based game competition

Over at freenode's #bbg irc channel, we're having a friendly game contest - a time-limited browser-based game contest, where all participants create a game around a randomly selected *genre* (not theme).  After it's all done, we'll get together and play/critique each other's games.

The timelimit is 12 hours, although this can be spread out as you like between Jan 1st and Feb 1st.

## Genres

The genre will be randomly selected from a list submitted to me on jan 31st.  Submit either via twitter @hughfdjackson w/ the hashtag #bbgcomp2, or in freenode's #bbg.  

Obviously, not all genres make a great candidates for time-limited games, so any genres that get 50% or more down-votes in #bbg or over twitter will be removed from the list.

#### Genre List:

* beat-em-up (a la streets of rage)
* FPS
* rogue-like
* top-down action rpg (a la early zelda)
* tower defense
* bullet-hell/space shooter (a la r-type)
* racing
* platform
* puzzle
* point & click adventure
* jRPG
* turn-based war strat (a la advance wars)
* RTS
* text-based adventure
* dating sim

## Motivation

It's mostly a learning experienced, and a chance to compare your solution to a genre's problems with that of your peers.
 Who doesn't want that?

## Rules

#### Dates

The competition runs between Jan 1st and Feb 1st.  Submit your entries to me by midnight Feb 1st local time

#### Time restriction

There is a 12 hour limit on the amount of time spent doing either programming or asset generation.  However, you can spend all the time you like:

* Thinking/conceptualising
* Drafting game design
* Looking for tools/art/music
* Playing games for comparison to *your* game
* Playing your own game. For reflection or funsies.
