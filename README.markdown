# Browser-Based game competition

Over at freenode's #bbg irc channel, we're having a friendly game contest - a time-limited browser-based game contest, where all participants create a game around one randomly selected *genre* (not theme).  After it's all done, we'll get together and play/critique each other's games.

The timelimit is 12 hours, although this can be spread out as you like between Jan 1st and Feb 1st.

## Genres

The Genre for the competition has been selected; it is:

### bullet-hell/space shooter (a la r-type)
 

It was selected at random from the list below (see evidence.mov for the live selection):

#### Genre List:

* beat-em-up (a la streets of rage)
* FPS
* [rogue-like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)
* top-down action rpg (a la early zelda)
* tower defense
* bullet-hell/space shooter (a la r-type)
* racing
* platform
* puzzle
* point & click adventure
* jRPG (a la final fantasy)
* turn-based war strat (a la advance wars)
* RTS
* text-based adventure (predominantly text, other media used for mood)
* dating sim
* sports sim 
* management sim

## Motivation

It's mostly a learning experience, and a chance to compare your solution to a genre's problems with that of your peers.
 Who doesn't want that?

## Rules

#### Content restriction

* Use only content you have a legal right to.
* PG13 content.  There's no problem with serious topics, but curb the explicit content.

#### Dates and submission

The competition runs between Jan 1st and Feb 1st.  Submit your entries to me by midnight Feb 1st local time.  If you can submit a .zip / link me to a github repo w/ your game in index.html and a README of your name, #bbg tag ( if you have one ) and any development notes you want to include for the benefit of others, that'd make it much easier!

N.B. All submissions are going to be open sourced (i.e. available through this repo).  If you're using proprietary tools, you'll have to host the game itself yourself, and provide a link.  You *must* submit your personal source code though.

#### Time restriction

There is a **12 hour limit** on the amount of time spent doing either programming or asset generation.

**However, you can spend any amount of time outside of the 12 hour limit doing the following**:

* Thinking/conceptualising
* Drafting game design
* Looking for tools/art/music
* Playing games for comparison to *your* game
* Playing your own game. For reflection or funsies.

#### Libs/tools

Use any lib or tool you like.  It's all fair game (no .. pun intended. honest).

#### Platform

Given that this is a competition for the browser-based games channel, the games will have to be .. browser-based.  

Having said that, though, since 12 hours is a tight deadline, feel free to specify that it only works on one particular platform (say, Chrome or Firefox).  Keep in mind that you benefit from more people being able to play your game, so if you specify some crazy tech, you may get fewer players and, therefore, less crit.
