# Browser-Based game competition

Over at freenode's #bbg irc channel, we're having a friendly game contest - a time-limited browser-based game contest, where all participants create a game around one randomly selected *genre* (not theme).  After it's all done, we'll get together and play/critique each other's games.

The timelimit is 12 hours, although this can be spread out as you like between Jan 1st and Feb 1st.

## Genres

#### Selecting a Genre for the competition

The competition will be based on a single genre for all entrants. That genre will be randomly selected from the _Genre List_ below on jan 1st.

If you want to see another game genre on that list, ask for it at #bbg or tweet at me (@hughfdjackson).

The reason for the random selection is to stop people voting for the fan-favourite genre; to get developers to move out of their comfort zone and consider different styles of games than they normally would.  The genre will be selected at midday on Jan 1st.


#### Genre List (so far):

* beat-em-up (a la streets of rage)
* FPS
* rogue-like
* top-down action rpg (a la early zelda)
* tower defense
* bullet-hell/space shooter (a la r-type)
* racing
* platform
* puzzle
* point & click adventure
* jRPG
* turn-based war strat (a la advance wars)
* RTS
* text-based adventure
* dating sim
* sports

## Motivation

It's mostly a learning experience, and a chance to compare your solution to a genre's problems with that of your peers.
 Who doesn't want that?

## Rules

#### Content restriction

* Use only content you have a legal right to.
* PG13 content.  There's no problem with serious topics, but curb the explicit content.

#### Dates and submission

The competition runs between Jan 1st and Feb 1st.  Submit your entries to me by midnight Feb 1st local time.  If you can submit a .zip / link me to a github repo w/ your game in index.html and a README of your name, #bbg tag ( if you have one ) and any development notes you want to include for the benefit of others, that'd make it much easier!

N.B. All submissions are going to be open sourced (i.e. available through this repo).  If you're using propriatory tools, you'll have to host the game itself yourself, and provide a link.  You *must* submit your personal source code though.

#### Time restriction

There is a 12 hour limit on the amount of time spent doing either programming or asset generation.  However, you can spend all the time you like:

* Thinking/conceptualising
* Drafting game design
* Looking for tools/art/music
* Playing games for comparison to *your* game
* Playing your own game. For reflection or funsies.

#### Libs/tools

Use any lib or tool you like.  It's all fair game (no .. pun intended. honest).

#### Platform

Given that this is a competition for the browser-based games channel, the games will have to be .. browser-based.  

Having said that, though, since 12 hours is a tight deadline, feel free to specify that it only works on one particular platform (say, Chrome or Firefox).  Keep in mind that you benefit from more people being able to play your game, so if you specify some crazy tech, you may get fewer players and, therefore, less crit.
